## üèÜ Key Learning Objectives

By the end of this guide, you will:

- ‚úÖ **Understand Go's memory model** and avoid common memory pitfalls
- ‚úÖ **Master Go's concurrency primitives** and write safe concurrent code  
- ‚úÖ **Design clean, maintainable APIs** using interfaces and composition

## üí° Philosophy

This guide follows Go's core philosophy:
- **Simplicity over complexity** - Choose the simplest solution that works
- **Composition over inheritance** - Build complex behavior from simple components
- **Explicit over implicit** - Make intentions clear in code
- **Concurrency is not parallelism** - Understand the difference and use appropriately
